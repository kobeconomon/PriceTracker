PriceTracker is an application that tracks the prices of a cruise that I want to go on. Will utilize Python to scrape airline and cruise websites, 
and will notify me if any prices change on a daily basis. This is a personal project for my own temporary use. I do not plan on making this public once 
sensitive info gets added to the codebase.
